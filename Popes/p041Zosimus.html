   St. Zosimus (417-418), a Greek by birth, succeeded Innocent in 417. His appointment of Patroclus, Bishop of Aries, as papal vicar over Vienne, Narbonne, and Marseilles, occasioned a dispute with the bishops of those seesâ€”a quarrel not settled for many years. When Celestius and Pelagius were condemned at Carthage in 411, they misrepresented things to the pope so skillfully that he wrote in their behalf to the African bishops; but. later he condemned Pelagianism in his which was accepted by nearly all the bishops of the world, except a few in Italy who supported the heretics until their final condemnation at the General Council of Ephesus (431).
