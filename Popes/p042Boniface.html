   &emsp;St. Boniface I (418-422), candidate of the higher clergy, was opposed by Eulalius, candidate of the lower clergy; and both were consecrated on the same day. A synod at Ravenna, convoked by the Emperor Honorius decreed that both claimants should leave Rome; and the bishop of Spoleto was appointed to substitute until the dispute should be settled. Eulalius, however, marched into Rome and took possession of the Lateran Basilica, thereby giving such offense that the emperor declared Boniface to be the legitimate pope; and Eulalius was transferred to another see. To prevent the recurrence of a similar scandal, the emperor, at the request of Pope Boniface, decreed that in subsequent doubtful elections a second election should be held.
   &emsp;Boniface withdrew extensive privileges given to the bishop of Aries by Pope Zosimus and restored the ancient rights of the other Gallic bishops. From the bishops of Africa Boniface received a curt letter which, while recognizing his authority, protested against the apparent dishonesty of his legates. With the aid of the Western emperor, Honorius, Pope Boniface succeeded in persuading Theodosius II to leave Illyricum under the jurisdiction of Rome instead of transferring it to Constantinople.
