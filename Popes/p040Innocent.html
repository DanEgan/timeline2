   St. Innocent I (402-417) exercised his authority in both East and West â€”in Illyria, in France, and in Spain. Appeals came to him, sometimes for protection, sometimes for a decision in matters of discipline, sometimes for a definition of Catholic doctrine. He made his influence felt in behalf of St. John Chrysostom, persecuted by the Empress Eudoxia; he reproached the bishop of Jerusalem for his failure to protect St. Jerome; he persuaded the Emperor Honorius to take action against the Montanists; and he supported the African bishops in their condemnation of Pelagianism.
