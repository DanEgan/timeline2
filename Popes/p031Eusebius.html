   St. Eusebius (309 or 310), who reigned only four months, was opposed by a faction under a certain Heraclius, who contested the pope's decision that apostates should be admitted to communion after proper penance. To end the dispute, the Emperor Maxentius banished both Eusebius and Heraclius. Eusebius, who died soon after his exile to Sicily, is considered a martyr.
