   St. Sixtus III (432-440), because of his kindly policy, was falsely accused of being tainted with Nestorianism and Pelagianism. He approved the acts of the Council of Ephesus; he attempted to act as peacemaker between Cyril of Alexandria and John of Antioch; and he asserted papal supremacy against the bishops of Illyricum.
