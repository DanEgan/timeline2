   &emsp;St. Gelasius I (492-496) is known to history as the man whose conception of authority dominated Christendom through the whole medieval period; and the early ages show no better evidence of the recognition of papal supremacy than this pope's deeds and writings. Particular significance attaches to the so-called a passage in his letter to the Emperor Anastasius, written in the year 494. In this passage Gelasius affirms that Anastasius, as emperor, has the obligation of safeguarding the faith, and that, in the discharge of this duty he must follow the judgment of the Holy Seeâ€”for, although the emperor is the secular ruler of the world, yet in spiritual matters he must obey the pope. It is hardly too much to say that for more than six hundred years the regulated the relationship between Church and State.
   &emsp;Gelasius made his authority felt in other ways, too. Despite powerful opposition, he put an end to the old licentious pagan festival of and he contributed greatly to the development of canon law and ecclesiastical discipline. He also composed many liturgical hymns and a Missal.
