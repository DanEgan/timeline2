<h3>

   St. Pontian (230-235) effected a reconciliation between the followers of Hippolytus and the Church. He presided over a synod which confirmed the condemnation of Origen's teachings. When banished to the Sardinian mines by Maximinus, he resigned the papacy in order to make possible the election of another pope.
