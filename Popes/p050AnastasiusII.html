   St. Anastasius II (496-498) continued the policy of Gelasius and removed the name of the Patriarch Acacius from the Diptychs of the Church. In spite of protests, he ruled that the sacramental acts of schismatics are valid. Anastasius condemned Traducianismâ€”the error which holds that the soul of the offspring originates by transmission from the parent.
