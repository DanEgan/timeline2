   St. Stephen I (254-257) is known mainly for his defense of the validity of heretical baptism against St. Cyprian who had ruled that persons baptized by heretics should be re-baptized before reception into the Church. Pope Stephen decided that Cyprian's practice ran counter to tradition. A council of African bishops, eighty-seven in number, endorsed Cyprian's practice in the year 256; and the churches of Asia Minor took the same position. The language of the letters exchanged between St. Stephen and St. Cyprian during the dispute indicates that the issue was merely disciplinary. Cyprian maintained that as bishop he had the right to settle the question for persons within his jurisdiction; whereas the pope insisted that there should be no innovation. Stephen was appealed to by the bishops of Gaul to condemn the followers of Novatian in that region; and he also received an appeal from two bishops of Spain who were accused of having lapsed from the faith. He provided for needy Christians in Syria and Arabia.
