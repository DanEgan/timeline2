   St. Siricius (384-398) demonstrated the right of the pope to govern the Universal Church by excommunicating Ithacius, a Spanish bishop, who, in his opposition to Priscillian, had gone so far as to denounce all asceticism and to accuse St. Martin of Tours of Manichaeism. In 385 Siricius wrote a famous letter to the bishops of Spain in which he ruled upon a number of disciplinary matters including clerical celibacy, threatened excommunication upon those who resisted, and reminded his readers that "Peter speaks through Siricius."
