   St. Hilary or Hilarius (461-468), a native of Sardinia, as legate of Leo I, had maintained the rights of the pope at the Robber Synod of Ephesus in 449; and he had barely escaped punishment at the hands of Dioscurus of Alexandria. He followed the policies of Leo. At the Roman synods of 462, 464, and 468, he upheld the papal jurisdiction over the bishops of Gaul and Spain; in 467 he rebuked the Emperor Anthemius for allowing one of his followers to promote the Macedonian heresy in Rome; and he sent an encyclical to the bishops of the Eastern Church confirming the teachings of the Councils of Nicaea, Ephesus, and Chalcedon.
