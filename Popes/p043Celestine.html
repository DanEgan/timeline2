   St. Celestine I (422-432) witnessed the beginning of Nestorianism. On the strength of St. Cyril's report, he ordered Nestorius to recant; but he then agreed to postpone the matter until the meeting of the Council of Ephesus in the following year and sent three legates to the council. Celestine had trouble with Manichaeans, Donatists, Novatians, and Pelagians; but his position was greatly strengthened by the loyal support of Galla Placidia, mother of Valentinian III. A devoted friend of St. Augustine, he prohibited the Semi-Pelagians from attacking the teaching of that saint; and he showed his interest in missions by sending St. Palladius and St. Patrick to the Irish.
