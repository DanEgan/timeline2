   St. Miltiades (or Melchiades) (311-314), after the Edict of Toleration, reorganized the administration of the Church and established the papal residence in the Lateran Palace donated by Constantine. At the request of Constantine in 313 he convoked a synod of eighteen bishops of Gaul and Italy to settle the Donatist controversy.
