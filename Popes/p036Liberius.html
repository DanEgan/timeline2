   St. Liberius (352-366). Of Liberius we know little more than the two facts that he was exiled by the Emperor Constantius for his refusal to condemn St. Athanasius, and that after his death his orthodoxy became the subject of long and fierce dispute. During his exile Constantius placed the Roman Archdeacon Felix on the papal throne; and when Liberius returned (after his rumored repudiation of Athanasius) the emperor proposed that Felix should cooperate with Liberius in the government of the Church. But the Romans, shouting "One God, one Christ, one Bishop," drove Felix from the city; and the Senate condemned him to perpetual banishment.
