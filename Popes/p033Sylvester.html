   St. Sylvester I (314-335). The pontificate of Sylvester coincided with twenty years of Constantine's reign; and in later times legends sprang up describing many imaginary episodes in the relationship of the pope and the emperor. History, however, records few details of this pontificate except the erecting of three basilicas in Rome (St. John Lateran, Santa Croce, and St. Peter), and Sylvester's dispatch of two Roman priests to represent him at the Council of Nicaea.
