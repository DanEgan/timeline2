   St. Marcellinus (296-304) began to rule just before the outbreak of the persecution under Diocletian. A hundred years after his death, a Donatist bishop in Africa affirmed that Marcellinus had denied the faith; but the truth of this report was questioned by St. Augustine. There remains however, a probability that during the persecution he did not behave with sufficient bravery to win the respect of the faithful.
