   &emsp;St. Leo I (440-461) is one of the two popes known by common agreement as "the Great." In the middle of the century, when the Monophysites had gained such favor that the emperor convoked a council at their request, Leo routed them by sending to Flavian, Patriarch of Constantinople, the dogmatic letter known as the Well trained in theology, a typical Roman, expressing himself clearly and forcibly, he summed up Catholic belief in the statement, "The One Person of Our Lord possesses two Natures, the Divine and the Human, neither confused nor mixed." The (Robber Synod), presided over by the heretical Dioscurus, ignored the pope; but the six hundred bishops at Chalcedon accepted his as an adequate summary of the Catholic faithâ€”"Peter has spoken through Leo."
   &emsp;Leo vigorously maintained papal rights. When writing, at the request of the emperor, to confirm the doctrinal definition of Chalcedon (so that there might be no doubt anywhere in the world of papal approval) he added a reminder that the regulations of Nicaea must remain unchanged, thus disapproving of Chalcedon's twentieth canon which claimed for Constantinople a certain equality with Rome.
   &emsp;It was Leo who persuaded Attila the Hun to spare Rome, who protected the Romans against Gaiseric the Vandal, who denied the claim of St. Hilary, the powerful bishop of Aries, to consecrate the bishops of Vienne, and who dealt firmly with widely scattered heretical movements, checking not only the Monophysites of the East but the Pelagians and Manichaeans of Italy and the Priscillianists of Spain.
