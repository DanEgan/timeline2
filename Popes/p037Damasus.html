   &emsp;St. Damasus I (366-384), successor of Liberius, had been a supporter of the antipope Felix; and when Damasus was elected pope, the party of his defeated rival, Ursinus, organized a riot and set up their leader as anti-pope. Having been banished by the Emperor Valentinian, Ursinus carried on a propaganda of calumny against Damasus who was, however, exonerated by the Emperor Gratian and by a Roman synod of forty-four bishops.
   <br>
   &emsp;A vigorous ruler, Damasus set St. Jerome to work on the Vulgate (a revised Latin translation of the Bible), published a list of the books of the New Testament (in 374), restored many Roman churches and catacombs, and built a marble monument, "the Platonia," to commemorate the temporary transfer of the bodies of Sts. Peter and Paul to the basilica of St. Sebastian a hundred years earlier. He cooperated with Valentinian in the enforcement of an edict of 370 which forbade ecclesiastics and monks (also nuns in a later amendment) to devote themselves to the securing of gifts from widows and orphans; he supported the Christian senators in their effort to have the Altar of Victory removed from the Senate House; and, before his death, the edict of Theodosius I in 380 had made him the head of the established religion of the Roman state.
   <br>
   &emsp;During this pontificate we come upon several evidences of the widespread recognition of papal supremacy. Damasus wrote to the bishops of Gaul reminding them of their obligation to obey the canons of the Church. He addressed the Eastern bishops in a tone which has been described as "wholly papal"; and they recognized his headship in the Church, although the nature of that headship was not yet clearly defined. In 379 the bishops of Spain consulted Damasus with regard to the heretical teaching of Priscillian; and a little later Priscillian came to Rome to seek the pope's support.
